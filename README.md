# ProjectKlio
Project Klio is a one player, text based RPG in the same vein as Zork and other similar text adventures with rouge like elements. Project Klio aims to provide a story built on dynamic blocks of text with user interaction as text commands that are processed using a custom natural language parser.

+ [Design Document](https://github.com/ChezzWizz/Klio/wiki/Design-Document)

To compile and run the code from the project src directory, use the standard java compiler "javac" and jvm command "java":

    javac klio\*.java
    java klio.Klio

With the default file located in the working directory when the application is run, this application will currently print out the data straight from the XML file showing that the maps have been populated and the Scene and Npc objects have been instantiated.
